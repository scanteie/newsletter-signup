# Creating Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the following details:
   - Repository name: `newsletter-signup`
   - Description: "Newsletter signup application with subscriber management and admin interface"
   - Make it Public or Private (your choice)
   - Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Do NOT add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - Do NOT add a license (you can add this later if needed)
3. Click "Create repository"

After creating the repository, come back here and I'll help you push your code to it.

Note: You'll need to authenticate with GitHub when pushing. You can do this by:
1. Using a Personal Access Token (recommended)
2. Using GitHub CLI
3. Using SSH keys

Would you like instructions for any of these authentication methods?
